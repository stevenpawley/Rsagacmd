Title: Dynamically generates R functions to link with SAGA-GIS
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Steven Pawley

Description: Rsagacmd provides a functional method of accessing SAGA-GIS tools and libraries. Rsagacmd works by dynamically generating R functions for every SAGA-GIS tool and embeds these functions within a nested list structure. This facilitates an easier scripting experience because the function's syntax are similar to using the SAGA-GIS command line tool directly, and the user can also take advantage of code autocompletion tools (e.g in Rstudio), allowing for each tools' inputs, outputs and options to be more easily recognized.
