Rsagacmd
========

Rsagacmd: A package for linking R with the open-source SAGA-GIS.

Rsagacmd is intended to provide an R scripting interface to the open-source SAGA-GIS (https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/) software. The current version has been tested using SAGA-GIS 2.3.2, 5.0.0, 6.0.0-6.3.0 on Windows (x64), OS X and Linux.

## Description

This package is not related to the RSAGA package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSAGA/index.html), which provides an alternative interface to SAGA-GIS. However in contrast to RSAGA, Rsagacmd emphasizes a fully function approach of scripting with SAGA-GIS by dynamically generating R functions for every SAGA-GIS tool based on the user's current SAGA installation. These functions are generated by the sagaGIS function and are contained within an S3 class object as a named list of libraries and tools. This facilitates an easier scripting experience by organizing the large number of SAGA-GIS tools (> 500) by their respective library. Each function's syntax is therfore similar to using the SAGA-GIS command line tool directly. Furthermore, because the arguments (called identifiers) for many SAGA-GIS tools are not consistently named, the user can also take advantage of code autocompletion tools (e.g. in Rstudio), allowing for each tools' inputs, outputs and options to be more easily recognized.

## Handling of geospatial and tabular data
Rsagacmd aims to facilitate a seamless interface to the open-source SAGA-GIS by providing access to all SAGA-GIS geoprocessing tools in a 'R-like' manner. In addition to mapping R functions to execute SAGA-GIS tools, Rsagacmd automatically handles the passing of geospatial and tabular data contained from the R environment to SAGA-GIS.

Rsagacmd uses the SAGA-GIS command line interface to perform geoprocessing operations. Therefore, all of the Rsagacmd tools allow paths to the input data to be used as arguments, if the data is stored in the appropriate file formats (e.g. GDAL-supported single-band rasters, OGR supported vector data, and comma- or tab-delimited text files for tabular data). In addition, Rsagacmd currently supports the following R object classes to pass data to SAGA-GIS, and to load the results back into the R environment:

- Raster data handling is provided by the R raster package. Raster-based outputs from SAGA-GIS tools are loaded as RasterLayer objects. For more details, see the 'Handling of raster data'.
- Vector features that result from SAGA-GIS geoprocessing operations are output in ESRI Shapefile format and are loaded into the R environment as simple features objects
- Tabular data from SAGA-GIS tools are loaded as dataframes

The results from tools that return multiple outputs are loaded into the R environment as a named list of the appropriate R object classes.

## Handling of raster data by Rsagacmd and SAGA-GIS
SAGA-GIS does not handle multi-band rasters and the native SAGA GIS Binary file format (.sgrd) supports only single band data. Therefore when passing raster data to most SAGA-GIS tools using Rsagacmd, the data should represent single raster bands, specified as either the path to the single raster band, or when using the R raster package, a RasterLayer (or less commonly a RasterStack or RasterBrick) object that contains only a single layer. Subsetting of raster data is performed automatically by Rsagacmd in the case of when a single band from a RasterStack or RasterBrick object is passed to a SAGA-GIS tool. This occurs in by either passing the filename of the raster to the SAGA-GIS command line, or by writing the data to a temporary file. However, a few SAGA-GIS functions will accept a list of single band rasters as an input. In this case if this data is in the form of a RasterStack or RasterLayer object, it is recommended to use the unstack function in the raster package, which will return a list of RasterLayer objects, and then Rsagacmd will handle the subsetting automatically.

## Combining SAGA-GIS tools with pipes

For convenience, non-optional outputs from SAGA-GIS are automatically saved to tempfiles if outputs are not explicitly stated, e.g.:
```
# Initialize SAGA-GIS as a S3 object

library(Rsagacmd)
saga = sagaGIS('C:/SAGA-GIS/saga_cmd.exe')

# Generate random terrain and save to file
dem = saga$grid_calculus$Random_Terrain(TARGET_OUT_GRID = 'terrain.sgrd')

# Terrain ruggedness index
tri = saga$ta_morphometry$Terrain_Ruggedness_Index_TRI(DEM=dem, RADIUS=3)
 ```
Will write the output terrain ruggedness index to a temporary file, and will automatically load the result into the R environment as a RasterLayer object. This was implemented for convenience, and so that the user can also create complex workflows that require very little code. It is also means that you can combine several processing steps with pipes:
```
# read project area as a simple features object
prj_bnd = st_read('some_shape.shp')
dem = raster('some_dem.tif')

# clip dem to shape, resample, and calculate potential incoming solar radiation
pisr = dem %>%
    saga$shapes_grid$Clip_Grid_with_Rectangle(SHAPES = prj_bnd)) %>%
    saga$grid_tools$Resampling(TARGET_USER_SIZE = 100) %>%
    saga$ta_lighting$Potential_Incoming_Solar_Radiation(
        LOCATION = 1, PERIOD = 2, DAY='2013-01-01', DAY_STOP = '2014-01-01',
        DAYS_STEP=10, HOUR_STEP=3, METHOD='Hofierka and Suri',
        GRD_LINKE_DEFAULT=3)
```
In the above example, three tools are joined together using pipes, and only the PISR grid is returned as a RasterLayer object. The intermediate processing steps are dealt with automatically by saving the outputs as tempfiles. When dealing with high-resolution and/or larger raster data, these tempfiles can start to consume a significant amount of disk space over a session. If required, temporary files can be cleaned during the session in a similar way to the raster package, using:
```
saga.removeTmpFiles(h=0).
```
where h is minimum age (in number of hours) of tempfiles for removal, so h=0 will remove all tempfiles that were automatically created by Rsagacmd.

### Notes
The newer SAGA-GIS compressed .sg-grd-z file format is not currently supported, although support may be added in future package updates.

## Package installation

#### First install the devtools package:
```
install.packages("devtools")
```

#### Next install Rsagacmd:
```
library(devtools)
install_github("stevenpawley/Rsagacmd")
```

## Package usage
```
# Initialize SAGA-GIS as a S3 object
library(Rsagacmd)
saga = sagaGIS('C:/SAGA-GIS/saga_cmd.exe')

# Generate random terrain and save to file
dem = saga$grid_calculus$Random_Terrain(
    TARGET_OUT_GRID = 'terrain.sgrd')

# Automatic use of tempfiles to store outputs
dem = saga$grid_calculus$Random_Terrain()

tri = saga$ta_morphometry$Terrain_Ruggedness_Index_TRI(
    DEM=dem, RADIUS=15, ITERATIONS=500)

# Example of chaining operations using pipes 
library(maggritr)

tri = saga$grid_calculus$Random_Terrain() %>%
    saga$ta_morphometry$Terrain_Ruggedness_Index_TRI(RADIUS=3)

# A more complex use of pipes to clip, resample and calculate PISR 
prj_bnd = st_read('some_shape.shp')
dem = raster('some_dem.tif')

pisr = dem %>%
    saga$shapes_grid$Clip_Grid_with_Rectangle(SHAPES = prj_bnd)) %>%
    saga$grid_tools$Resampling(TARGET_USER_SIZE = 100) %>%
    saga$ta_lighting$Potential_Incoming_Solar_Radiation(
        LOCATION = 1, PERIOD = 2, DAY='2013-01-01', DAY_STOP = '2014-01-01',
        DAYS_STEP=10, HOUR_STEP=3, METHOD='Hofierka and Suri',
        GRD_LINKE_DEFAULT=3)

# Remove tempfiles generated by Rsagacmd during a session 
sagaRemoveTmpFiles(h=0)
```
